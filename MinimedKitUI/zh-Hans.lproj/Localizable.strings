"Alkaline and Lithium batteries decay at differing rates. Alkaline tend to have a linear voltage drop over time whereas lithium cell batteries tend to maintain voltage until halfway through their lifespan. Under normal usage in a Non-MySentry compatible Minimed (x22/x15) insulin pump running Loop, Alkaline batteries last approximately 4 to 5 days. Lithium batteries last between 1-2 weeks. This selection will use different battery voltage decay rates for each of the battery chemistry types and alert the user when a battery is approximately 8 to 10 hours from failure." = "碱性电池和锂电池以不同的速率衰减。随着时间的推移，碱性电池往往具有线性电压降，而锂电池电池则随时间呈线性下降的电压一直保持到其寿命的一半。在非MySentry兼容Minimed（x22 / x15）的胰岛素泵运行Loop时，正常使用情况下，碱性电池可持续大约4至5天，锂电池持续1-2周。此选择将针对每种电池化学类型使用不同的电池电压衰减速率，并在电池电量耗尽前8至10小时前提醒用户。";
