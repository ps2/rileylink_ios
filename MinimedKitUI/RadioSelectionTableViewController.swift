Reading event history allows for a more accurate status graph and uploading up-to-date treatment data to Nightscout, at the cost of faster pump battery drain and the possibility of a higher radio error rate compared to reading only reservoir volume. If the selected source cannot be used for any reason, the system will attempt to fall back to the other option.", comment: "Instructions on selecting an insulin data source")

Alkaline tend to have a linear voltage drop over time whereas lithium cell batteries tend to maintain voltage until halfway through their lifespan. Under normal usage in a Non-MySentry compatible Minimed (x22/x15) insulin pump running Loop, Alkaline batteries last approximately 4 to 5 days. Lithium batteries last between 1-2 weeks. This selection will use different battery voltage decay rates for each of the battery chemistry types and alert the user when a battery is approximately 8 to 10 hours from failure.", comment: "Instructions on selecting battery chemistry type")
